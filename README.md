# JPMC Task 1
## Background 
You’ve been asked to assist with some development to add a chart to a trader’s dashboard allowing them to better identify under/over-valued stocks.

The trader would like to be able to monitor two historically correlated stocks and be able to visualise when the correlation between the two weakens (i.e. one stock moves proportionally more than the historical correlation would imply). This could indicate a potential trade strategy to simultaneously buy the relatively underperforming stock and sell the relatively outperforming stock. Assuming the two prices subsequently converge, the trade should be profitable.

Most data visualisation for our traders is built on JPMorgan Chase's Perspective data visualisation software, which is now open source. If you want to explore that, a link is provided in the resources section.

## What I did
For the first task of this project you will need to accomplish the following:

<ol><li>Set up your local dev environment by downloading the necessary files, tools and dependencies.</li>
<li>Fix the broken client datafeed script in the repository by making the required adjustments to it.</li>
<li>Generate a patch file of the changes you made</li></ol>
